      "              Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that[9] : 199–200 uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.\n",

      "              From another angle to view deep learning, deep learning refers to \"computer-simulate\" or \"automate\" human learning processes from a source (e.g., an image of dogs) to a learned object (dogs). Therefore, a notion coined as \"deeper\" learning or \"deepest\" learning[10] makes sense. The deepest learning refers to the fully automatic learning from a source to a final learned object. A deeper learning thus refers to a mixed learning process: a human learning process from a source to a learned semi-object, followed by a computer learning process from the human learned semi-object to a final learned object.\n",

      "              Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered artificial neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "              In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.[12][13]\n",
      "\n",
      "              The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.[14] No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.[15] Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "              Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method.[16] Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.[12]\n",

      "              The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions.[19][20][21][22] In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions[19] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik.[20] Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima's rectified linear unit.[26][27]\n",
      "\n",
      "              The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al.[23] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.\n",
      "\n",
      "              The probabilistic interpretation[25] derives from the field of machine learning. It features inference,[9][11][12][14][17][25] as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function.[25] The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop.[28]\n",

      "              There are two types of neural networks: feedforward neural networks (FNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created and analyzed the Ising model[29] which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive.[30][31] His learning RNN was popularised by John Hopfield in 1982.[32] RNNs have become central for speech recognition and language processing.\n",

It also introduced variants, including a version with four-layer perceptrons where the last two layers have learned weights (and thus a proper multilayer perceptron) (,[34] section 16). In addition, term deep learning was proposed in 1986 by Rina Dechter Dechter (1986) although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated.[35]\n",

Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation[45] already in 1960 in the context of control theory.[31] In 1982, Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to MLPs in the way that has become standard.[46][47][31] In 1985, David E.

They also proposed an implementation of the CNN with an optical computing system.[54][55] In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. applied backpropagation to a CNN with the purpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. While the algorithm worked, training required 3 days.[56] Subsequently, Wei Zhang, et al. modified their model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in 1991[57] and breast cancer detection in mammograms in 1994.[58] LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al.,[59] that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel images.\n",

      "              In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, Jürgen Schmidhuber (1992) proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning.[60] It uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network.[60][31] In 1993, a chunker solved a deep learning task whose depth exceeded 1000.[61]\n",

It learns internal spotlights of attention:[65] a slow feedforward neural network learns by gradient descent to control the fast weights of another neural network through outer products of self-generated activation patterns FROM and TO (which are now called key and value for self-attention).[63] This fast weight attention mapping is applied to a query pattern.\n",

Transformers are also increasingly being used in computer vision.[68]\n",

      "              In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one network's gain is the other network's loss.[69][70][71] The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in a generative adversarial network (GAN) by Ian Goodfellow et al.[72] Here the environmental reaction is 1 or 0 depending on whether the first network's output is in a given set. This can be used to create realistic deepfakes.[73] Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia's StyleGAN (2018)[74] based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al.[75] Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion.\n",

This led to the deep learning method called long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1997.[78] LSTM recurrent neural networks can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks[14] with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. The \"vanilla LSTM\" with forget gate was introduced in 1999 by Felix Gers, Schmidhuber and Fred Cummins.[79] LSTM has become the most cited neural network of the 20th century.[31] In 2015, Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, Klaus Greff, and Schmidhuber used LSTM principles to create the Highway network, a feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers, much deeper than previous networks.[80][81] 7 months later, Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang; Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun won the ImageNet 2015 competition with an open-gated or gateless Highway network variant called Residual neural network.[82] This has become the most cited neural network of the 21st century.[31]\n",

Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition. The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation.[92] The SRI deep neural network was then deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning.[93] The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s,[93] showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms.

It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems.[104] The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different,[105] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems.[9][106][107] Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition.[105] That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.[104][105][108] In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees.[109][110][111][106]\n",

For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images.

Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning[37] or weight decay (-regularization) or sparsity (-regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting.[153] Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. This helps to exclude rare dependencies.[154] Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting.[155]\n",

Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples)[156] speed up computation.

Galkin et al. used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples.[234] The clock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls: IBD, frontotemporal dementia, ovarian cancer, obesity. The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity.\n",

      "\n",
      "                Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s.[235][236][237][238] These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\".[239]\n",
      "\n",
      "                A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism.[240][241] Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks, may be closer to biological reality.[242][243] In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.[244]\n",
      "\n",
      "                Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons[245] and neural populations.[246] Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system[247] both at the single-unit[248] and at the population[249] levels.\n",

Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot with the ability to learn new tasks through observation.[228] Using Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in-person. The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer, who provided feedback such as \"good job\" and \"bad job\".[256]\n",

      "                A main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods.[257] Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent. However, the theory surrounding other algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear.[ citation needed ] (e.g., Does it converge? If so, how fast? What is it approximating?) Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box, with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.[258]\n",

      "                Others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI, not as an all-encompassing solution.

      "\n",
      "                Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines. Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (...) have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used. The most powerful A.I. systems, like Watson (...) use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning.[259]\n",

      "\n",
      "                As deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception.[268] By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Such manipulation is termed an \"adversarial attack\".[269]\n",
      "\n",
      "                In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal points, and thereby generate images that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to human eyes. Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system.[270] One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it. A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.[271]\n",

      "                  Most Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated by humans.[272] It has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-paid clickwork (e.g. on Amazon Mechanical Turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose, but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such.[273] The philosopher Rainer Mühlhoff distinguishes five types of \"machinic capture\" of human microwork to generate training data: (1) gamification (the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game), (2) \"trapping and tracking\" (e.g. CAPTCHAs for image recognition or click-tracking on Google search results pages), (3) exploitation of social motivations (e.g. tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images), (4) information mining (e.g. by leveraging quantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and (5) clickwork.[273]\n",
      "\n",
      "                  Mühlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning such as Facebook's face recognition system, the need for training data does not stop once an ANN is trained. Rather, there is a continued demand for human-generated verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ANN. For this purpose, Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image, they receive a notification. They can choose whether or not they like to be publicly labeled on the image, or tell Facebook that it is not them in the picture.[274] This user interface is a mechanism to generate \"a constant stream of verification data\"[273] to further train the network in real-time. As Mühlhoff argues, the involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning that such systems may be referred to as \"human-aided artificial intelligence\".[273]\n",

      "may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom,\n",
      "middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of fea-\n",
      "tures decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but\n",
      "that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random\n",
      "features. A ﬁnal surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred\n",
      "features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization\n",
      "that lingers even after ﬁne-tuning to the target dataset.\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Modern deep neural networks exhibit a curious phenomenon: when trained on images, they all tend\n",
      "to learn ﬁrst-layer features that resemble either Gabor ﬁlters or color blobs. The appearance of these\n",
      "ﬁlters is so common that obtaining anything else on a natural image dataset causes suspicion of\n",
      "poorly chosen hyperparameters or a software bug. This phenomenon occurs not only for different\n",
      "datasets, but even with very different training objectives, including supervised image classiﬁcation\n",
      "(Krizhevsky et al. , 2012), unsupervised density learning (Lee et al. , 2009), and unsupervised learn-\n",
      "ing of sparse representations (Le et al. , 2011).\n",
      "Because ﬁnding these standard features on the ﬁrst layer seems to occur regardless of the exact cost\n",
      "function and natural image dataset, we call these ﬁrst-layer features general . On the other hand, we\n",
      "know that the features computed by the last layer of a trained network must depend greatly on the\n",
      "chosen dataset and task. For example, in a network with an N-dimensional softmax output layer that\n",
      "has been successfully trained toward a supervised classiﬁcation objective, each output unit will be\n",
      "speciﬁc to a particular class. We thus call the last-layer features speciﬁc . These are intuitive notions\n",
      "ofgeneral andspeciﬁc for which we will provide more rigorous deﬁnitions below. If ﬁrst-layer\n",
      "1--new page --\n",
      "features are general and last-layer features are speciﬁc, then there must be a transition from general\n",
      "to speciﬁc somewhere in the network. This observation raises a few questions:\n",
      "\u000fCan we quantify the degree to which a particular layer is general or speciﬁc?\n",
      "\u000fDoes the transition occur suddenly at a single layer, or is it spread out over several layers?\n",
      "\u000fWhere does this transition take place: near the ﬁrst, middle, or last layer of the network?\n",
      "We are interested in the answers to these questions because, to the extent that features within a\n",
      "network are general, we will be able to use them for transfer learning (Caruana, 1995; Bengio\n",
      "et al. , 2011; Bengio, 2011). In transfer learning, we ﬁrst train a base network on a base dataset and\n",
      "task, and then we repurpose the learned features, or transfer them, to a second target network to\n",
      "be trained on a target dataset and task. This process will tend to work if the features are general,\n",
      "meaning suitable to both base and target tasks, instead of speciﬁc to the base task.\n",
      "When the target dataset is signiﬁcantly smaller than the base dataset, transfer learning can be a\n",
      "powerful tool to enable training a large target network without overﬁtting; Recent studies have\n",
      "taken advantage of this fact to obtain state-of-the-art results when transferring from higher layers\n",
      "(Donahue et al. , 2013a; Zeiler and Fergus, 2013; Sermanet et al. , 2014), collectively suggesting that\n",
      "these layers of neural networks do indeed compute features that are fairly general. These results\n",
      "further emphasize the importance of studying the exact nature and extent of this generality.\n",
      "The usual transfer learning approach is to train a base network and then copy its ﬁrst nlayers to\n",
      "the ﬁrst nlayers of a target network. The remaining layers of the target network are then randomly\n",
      "initialized and trained toward the target task. One can choose to backpropagate the errors from\n",
      "the new task into the base (copied) features to ﬁne-tune them to the new task, or the transferred\n",
      "feature layers can be left frozen , meaning that they do not change during training on the new task.\n",
      "The choice of whether or not to ﬁne-tune the ﬁrst nlayers of the target network depends on the\n",
      "size of the target dataset and the number of parameters in the ﬁrst nlayers. If the target dataset is\n",
      "small and the number of parameters is large, ﬁne-tuning may result in overﬁtting, so the features\n",
      "are often left frozen. On the other hand, if the target dataset is large or the number of parameters is\n",
      "small, so that overﬁtting is not a problem, then the base features can be ﬁne-tuned to the new task\n",
      "to improve performance. Of course, if the target dataset is very large, there would be little need to\n",
      "transfer because the lower level ﬁlters could just be learned from scratch on the target dataset. We\n",
      "compare results from each of these two techniques — ﬁne-tuned features or frozen features — in\n",
      "the following sections.\n",
      "In this paper we make several contributions:\n",
      "1. We deﬁne a way to quantify the degree to which a particular layer is general or speciﬁc, namely,\n",
      "how well features at that layer transfer from one task to another (Section 2). We then train pairs\n",
      "of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet dataset and characterize the layer-by-layer\n",
      "transition from general to speciﬁc (Section 4), which yields the following four results.\n",
      "2. We experimentally show two separate issues that cause performance degradation when us-\n",
      "ing transferred features without ﬁne-tuning: (i) the speciﬁcity of the features themselves, and\n",
      "(ii) optimization difﬁculties due to splitting the base network between co-adapted neurons on\n",
      "neighboring layers. We show how each of these two effects can dominate at different layers of\n",
      "the network. (Section 4.1)\n",
      "3. We quantify how the performance beneﬁts of transferring features decreases the more dissimilar\n",
      "the base task and target task are. (Section 4.2)\n",
      "4. On the relatively large ImageNet dataset, we ﬁnd lower performance than has been previously\n",
      "reported for smaller datasets (Jarrett et al. , 2009) when using features computed from random\n",
      "lower-layer weights vs. trained weights. We compare random weights to transferred weights—\n",
      "both frozen and ﬁne-tuned—and ﬁnd the transferred weights perform better. (Section 4.3)\n",
      "5. Finally, we ﬁnd that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number\n",
      "of layers can produce a boost to generalization performance after ﬁne-tuning to a new dataset.\n",
      "This is particularly surprising because the effect of having seen the ﬁrst dataset persists even\n",
      "after extensive ﬁne-tuning. (Section 4.1)\n",

      "a neural network, which reveals their generality or speciﬁcity. We showed how transferability is\n",
      "negatively affected by two distinct issues: optimization difﬁculties related to splitting networks in\n",
      "the middle of fragilely co-adapted layers and the specialization of higher layer features to the original\n",
      "task at the expense of performance on the target task. We observed that either of these two issues\n",
      "may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of\n",
      "the network. We also quantiﬁed how the transferability gap grows as the distance between tasks\n",
      "increases, particularly when transferring higher layers, but found that even features transferred from\n",
      "distant tasks are better than random weights. Finally, we found that initializing with transferred\n",
      "features can improve generalization performance even after substantial ﬁne-tuning on a new task,\n",
